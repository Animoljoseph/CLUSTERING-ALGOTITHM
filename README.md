# CLUSTERING-ALGOTITHM
THE IRIS DATASET IS A RENOWNED COLLECTION USED EXTENSIVELY FOR TESTING MACHINE LEARINNIG ALHORITHMS.IT CONSISTS OF 150 SAMPLES EACH REPRESENTING.
ONE OF THREE SPECIESOF IRIS FLOWERS:IRIS-SETOSA, IRIS-VERSICOLOR,AND IRIS-VIRGINICA
IN THIS STUDY,THE DATASET WAS SUBJECTED TO CLUSTERING USING TWO DIFFERENT ALOGTITHMS.KMEANS AND HIERARCHICAL CLUTERING.BOTH ALOTITHAM ARE COMMONLY APPLIED IN CLASSIFICATION TASKS,AND WHILE KMEANS SEEMS TO PROVIDE A MORE ACCURATE GROUPING IN CASE, HIERARCHICAL CLUSTERING CAN REVEAL ADDITIONAL RELATIONSHIP THAT MIGHT BE BENEFICAL FOR MORE COMPLEX DATA ANALYSIS.
